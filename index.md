# Gesture Controlled Car with Accelerometer 
 This project consists of a car being controlled by a remote glove which the user wears to control the car. The glove contains an accelerometer which detects the change in orientation and movement on the glove. This information is then sent to the car through bluetooth modules which instructs the car to move or turn in a certain direction.

# Final Milestone
For my final milestone, I had to finish constructing my gesture controlled car and the glove. But most importantly, I had to get it to function. To do this, I started off with obtaining some code that looked like it would work for my robot. After changing the pin defenitions to match my hardware, I had to change the code so that one arduino actually sends information to the other arduino through bluetooth. After learning the write commands to send information from one arduino to the other, I was able to get my car to work. Although, another problem arose. The wheels were turning very inconsistently. All four wheels would rarely operate all at once. I realized that this was likely because of a hardware or power issue. When I replaced the batteries for new ones, the car and controller operated perfectly. Lastly, I decided to transfer the electronics for the glove, from the breadboard to the perfboard. I soldered everything onto the perfboard and the project was finally finished.

# Second Milestone
My second milestone was to get all of the wiring for my hardware set up. I was able to build and test all of my motors, bluetooth modules and accelerometer for car and controller glove. I got them to work by connecting them to an arduino and uploading some sample code to get them up and running. Some challenges I've faced during this milestone was getting the motors set up and working correctly. Because I didn't have a soldering kit, I had to carefully fold the metal ends of the wires into the motor's copper holes. This was challenging because if the connection was not secure, the motor would not receive power and would stop working. After this, I had to get my bluetooth modules paired so that I can transfer information from my controller to my car.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was testing to see whether my accelerometer was functioning properly. The accelerometer is one of the main sensors in my project and it is the sensor which gives values to the vehicle while I change the orientation of my hand and make gestures. To test my accelerometer, I had to connect my accelerometer to a breadboard which had to be connected to the arduino uno. I connnected the arduino uno to my laptop which had code running, to view the values of the accelerometer. This first milestone took more time than it was supposed because I ran into some big problems. I couldn't get my acclerometer to give any values, but it seemed like both the software and hardware were correct. After a few days of debugging and testing different accelerometers, I learned I wasn't supposed to connect all 10 of the accelerometer's pins to the breadboard, instead I was supposed to only connect the 4 pins which were needed for the arduino.
