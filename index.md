# Gesture Controlled Car with Accelerometer 
 This project consists of a car being controlled by a remote glove which the user wears to control the car. The glove contains an accelerometer which detects the change in orientation and movement on the glove. This information is then sent to the car through bluetooth modules which instructs the car to move or turn in a certain direction.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was testing to see whether my accelerometer was functioning properly. The accelerometer is one of the main sensors in my project and it is the sensor which gives values to the vehicle while I change the orientation of my hand and make gestures. To test my accelerometer, I had to connect my accelerometer to a breadboard which had to be connected to the arduino uno. I connnected the arduino uno to my laptop which had code running, to view the values of the accelerometer. This first milestone took more time than it was supposed because I ran into some big problems. I couldn't get my acclerometer to give any values, but it seemed like both the software and hardware were correct. After a few days of debugging and testing different accelerometers, I learned I wasn't supposed to connect all 10 of the accelerometer's pins to the breadboard, instead I was supposed to only connect the 4 pins which were needed for the arduino.
